# Buy the hardware

Getting the hardware should be quite easy as there are only two active parts involved. Both are easy to get and quite cheap.

## ESP32 (wifi-enabled microcontroller with superpowers)

The [ESP32](http://esp32.net/) is a microcontroller made by espressif that is quite powerful (up to 2 cores running with up tp 240 MHz and a ULP co-processor, 448 kB ROM and 520 kB RAM) and has many built-in features like WiFi and Bluetooth and much more. The best thing thing is that it's dirt cheap and available as handy development boards in many flavours. These dev boards have the GPIO pins exposed as external connectors to make the connection of peripherals easy. They should also have a Micro-USB connector included to make it easy to program them.

I used a [DOIT ESP32 DevKit v1](https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/board.zerynth.doit_esp32/docs/index.html) but any other ESP32 dev board should work also.

These boards come in different form factors and sometime with extra features. They are usually named:
- ESP32 NodeMCU 
- ESP32 DevKit C
- Lolin32
- Wemos MINI D1 ESP32
- Adafruit HUZZAH32
- Trigboard, M5 Stack, ...

Price should be below 15 â‚¬ / $ for a simple board:

- https://www.amazon.com/Official-Development-Bluetooth-Ultra-Low-Consumption/dp/B07VH89638

You can these even cheaper (less than 5 $) if you order directly from china:
