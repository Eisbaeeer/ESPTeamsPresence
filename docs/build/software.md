# Flashing the software


## Using prebuild firmware version (recommended)

If you're building the project the described way, the easiest approach to flash the software is to use the prebuilt firmware versions. You can find the latest build on the [releases page](https://github.com/toblum/ESPTeamsPresence/releases/tag/v0.3.0). Download the "firmware.bin".

Get the [nodemcu-pyflasher](https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher).

## Build your own version using platform.io and VSCode
